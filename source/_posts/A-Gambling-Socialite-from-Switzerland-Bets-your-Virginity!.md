#  A Gambling Socialite from Switzerland Bets your Virginity!

In a recent turn of events, a wealthy young socialite from Switzerland placed a rather large and unconventional bet with an unsuspecting person. The wager: their virginity!

The story began to circulate when screenshots of the alleged bet were shared on social media. In the screenshots, the socialite can be seen bragging about his upcoming winnings. He claims that he has already weighed the offered items and has determined that he will come out ahead.

The terms of the bet are as follows: if the person who has been challenged can manage to get more than ten kisses from members of the opposite sex within 24 hours, they win back their virginity. However, if they fail to kiss ten people or more, they must forfeit their virginity to the socialite.

Naturally, this news spread like wildfire and many people had strong opinions on the matter. Some felt that the socialite was being unfair and that the person being challenged should be allowed to keep their innocence. Others argued that it was a fair game, as both parties were aware of what was at stake.

Interestingly enough, there are no rules against such bets in Switzerland. As long as all participants are willing and over 18 years old, any type of wager is allowed. This fact has not stopped others from criticizing the socialite however, as they feel that he is taking advantage of someone who may not be able to win fairly.

#  Woman Claims She Can Win Virginity in a Gambling Bet!

When Brooke Fields went to a casino in Atlantic City, she wagered $5,000 that she could win back her virginity. She claimed that she has never had sex before and was willing to put her claim to the test.

Fields says that she made the wager with a group of friends and that they all agreed to it. She also mentioned that she is not 100% sure if she is still a virgin, but is adamant about wanting to find out.

After making the bet, one of Fields' friends videotaped the entire experience so they could all prove that she won. Apparently, Fields did not have too much trouble winning as she managed to score big at blackjack and roulette.

In the end, Fields walked away with more than just her virginity - $11,000 richer! While some may call this woman foolish for gambling away something as precious as her virginity, others might admire her for taking on such a challenge.

#  Swiss Lady Offers to Gamble Your Virginity Away!

double dare you

In a recent Facebook post that's now gone viral, a Swiss woman has boldly offered to bet her European country's citizenship against someone's virginity. Interestingly, she didn't specify whether the offer is only for men or also for women. In addition, the amount of money she's proposing to wager has not been disclosed as well.

All we know so far is that the Swiss lady is quite confident about her country's citizenship and that she's willing to put it all on the line for a chance at someone's virginity. This surely makes for an intriguing social media post, doesn't it? So far, there hasn't been any responses from anyone brave enough to take up her offer. But who knows? Maybe someone will eventually rise up to the challenge!

Interestingly, this isn't the first time that something like this has happened in Europe. A few years ago, a similar offer was made by a Croatian man who was also willing to bet his citizenship against someone's virginity. Obviously, no one took him up on his offer either. It will be interesting to see if history repeats itself this time around!

#  Swiss Socialite Wants to Gamble Away Virginity!

30-year old socialite, Alice Lam wants to gamble away her virginity in exchange for a luxury holiday. The young woman who hails from Zurich, Switzerland is no stranger to the high life and has already splurged on $220,000 worth of luxury items in her short lifetime. According to Lam, she's been saving her virginity for someone special, but has since grown tired of waiting.

"I'm not getting any younger and I want to enjoy myself," said Lam in an interview with tabloid magazine, OK!. "I could easily have sex with someone I don't care about, but that's not what I'm looking for. I want the whole experience to be special."

Lam has set her sights on a luxurious holiday package that includes a five-star hotel stay, private jet flights and VIP access to all the best nightlife spots. In order to win the prize, she's willing to let a wealthy man take her virginity in a poker game or blackjack match.

"I know I can win this prize if I put my mind to it," said Lam confidently. "I'm not scared of taking risks and I'm ready for anything."

While some people might see Lam's decision as reckless and immature, she sees it as a way to have fun and enjoy life to the fullest. She's even open to marrying the man who wins her virginity – providing he meets her high standards, of course.

"If he's rich, successful and can make me laugh then I'll definitely consider him," said Lam. "Money is important to me, but it's not everything."
