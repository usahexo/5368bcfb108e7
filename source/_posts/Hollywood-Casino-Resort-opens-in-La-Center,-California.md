#  Hollywood Casino Resort opens in La Center, California

The Hollywood Casino Resort is a new addition to the city of La Center, California. The casino resort is a $240 million development that opened in late 2017. The casino resort has more than 1,000 slot machines and 40 gaming tables. It also has a hotel with 214 rooms, a spa, and several restaurants.

The Hollywood Casino Resort was developed by Penn National Gaming, which operates casinos and racetracks throughout the United States. The company has been looking to expand its operations into California for many years. Penn National already operates two other casinos in California—the Hollywood Casino Jamul-San Diego and the Graton Resort & Casino in Rohnert Park.

The opening of the Hollywood Casino Resort in La Center represents a major victory for the city and for Clark County as a whole. The casino resort is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue each year. It will also help to support local businesses and bring new tourists to the area.

The Hollywood Casino Resort is now the largest employer in La Center and one of the largest employers in Clark County.
