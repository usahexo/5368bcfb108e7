#  Maryland lawmakers pass bill to legalize mobile sports betting

After months of negotiation and debate, the Maryland General Assembly has passed a bill to legalize mobile sports betting in the state. The measure, HB 992, was approved by the Senate on Monday and the House of Delegates on Tuesday, and now heads to Governor Larry Hogan for his signature.

Under the proposed bill, residents age 21 or older would be able to place bets on sporting events through their smartphones or other mobile devices. Wagering would be available at casinos, racetracks, and other authorized venues across the state.

 Supporters of the bill argue that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state government, while also creating new jobs and stimulating economic growth. “This is about creating new economic opportunities for our citizens and businesses,” said Delegate Wiener, one of the bill’s sponsors.

Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social harms. But Weiner dismissed those concerns as “nonsense”, noting that similar laws have been implemented in other states without incident.

Assuming Governor Hogan signs it into law, Maryland will become the latest state to legalize mobile sports betting. New Jersey was the first to do so last year, followed by several other states including West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi.

#  Mobile sports betting coming to Maryland casinos

Casinos in Maryland will soon offer mobile sports betting, pending a final ruling from the state’s gambling regulator.

The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (MLGCA) said it had approved an application from Live! Casino & Hotel to offer mobile sports betting. The casino is owned by the Cordish Companies, which also owns Baltimore’s Horseshoe Casino.

Other casinos in the state are expected to follow suit, including MGM National Harbor, which opened in December 2016 as the state’s first Las Vegas-style casino.

David Cordish, chairman of the Cordish Companies, said that the approval was a “significant day” for his company.

“This is a historic moment for us and we are grateful to the MLGCA for their diligent work on this application,” he said.

The move comes as states across the US begin to legalise sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling in May that struck down a federal ban on the practice. Delaware became the first state to offer full-fledged sports betting on June 5, while New Jersey is expected to launch its own sports betting operation later this month.

Maryland joins a growing list of states where mobile sports betting is either legal or about to become legal. These include Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

#  Maryland set to offer mobile sports betting by early 2019

The state of Maryland is all set to offer mobile sports betting by early 2019. The decision was announced by the state’s gaming board on Monday,October 8th.

According to the board, six casino operators in the state have already applied for licenses to offer mobile sports betting. These include Hollywood Casino Perryville, Casino at Ocean Downs, Live! Casino & Hotel, Rocky Gap Casino Resort, M&T Bank Stadium and Gillette Stadium.

“I am happy to see that our casinos are getting ready to launch this product and offer it to our customers who love sports betting,” said Gaming Board Chairman Stephen Martino.

Under the proposed regulations, casino operators in Maryland will be able to offer mobile betting both at their premises as well as off-site. However, they will not be allowed to accept wagers from players located outside the state of Maryland.

The proposed regulations also call for a minimum age of 21 for those looking to bet on sports in the state. In addition, casino operators will be required to pay a 6.5% tax on all sports wagers placed through their platforms.

Mobile betting is expected to generate significant revenue for the state of Maryland; however,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) it is still unclear how much exactly this will be. Estimates suggest that the market could be worth anywhere between $100 million and $300 million annually.

#  State-of-the-art mobile sports betting coming soon to Maryland 

If you're a fan of sports betting, Maryland is about to become your new favorite state. A consortium of leading gambling companies has announced plans to open a mobile sports betting app in the state in time for the start of the NFL season.

The app, which will be operated by DraftKings, BetStars, and PlaySugarHouse, will offer bettors the chance to wager on NFL, NBA, MLB, and NCAA games. The app will also offer a variety of prop bets and in-game betting options.

"We are excited to launch our mobile sports betting product in Maryland," said Matt Kalish, Chief Revenue Officer for DraftKings. "This is a great opportunity to provide our customers with a world-class experience when they want to bet on sports."

The app is expected to be available in late August or early September. In addition to the standard pre-match and in-play bets, it will offer streaming of selected games, as well as news and analysis from top sportswriters.

It's not yet clear how much tax revenue the new app will generate for the state, but officials are optimistic that it will be a major boon for Maryland's economy. "This is an important step forward for Maryland's gaming industry," said Governor Larry Hogan. "It will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for our schools and our casinos."

#  Maryland lawmakers race to legalize mobile sports betting before other states do

Lawmakers in the state of Maryland are currently racing to legalize mobile sports betting before other states do. This is in response to the Supreme Court overturning a federal ban on sports betting last month.

This move would allow bettors in Maryland to place bets on sporting events through their smartphones or other internet-connected devices. It is estimated that legalizing mobile sports betting could generate up to $50 million in annual revenue for the state.

Some lawmakers in Maryland are concerned that allowing sports betting could lead to an increase in gambling addiction and other social problems. However, others argue that the regulation of mobile sports betting can help mitigate these risks.

It is unclear whether or not Maryland will be able to legalize mobile sports betting before other states do. However, with the landscape of gambling laws changing rapidly, it is certainly possible.
