#  Slot machines raked in $52 billion in profits for casinos in 2017 – Live 888

Slot machines are big business for casinos, accounting for more than half of all gambling profits in the United States in 2017. According to industry research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, slot machines raked in $52 billion in profits for casinos last year. That’s a nearly 10% increase over the $47.6 billion generated by slots in 2016.

The growth of slots has come at the expense of other forms of gambling, such as blackjack and craps. In 2017, casino profits from those games were down 5% and 2%, respectively, from the previous year. Slot machines now account for more than two-thirds of casino gambling revenue in the U.S., up from just over half a decade ago.

Part of the reason for the continued popularity of slots is their simplicity. There’s no skill required to play them, unlike blackjack or craps, so they’re ideal for people who just want to gamble and not worry about complex rules. Slot machines are also a good option for players who want to risk small amounts of money: The average bet on a slot machine is just 25 cents, compared with $15 or more at a blackjack table.

Slot machines have been around since the late 1800s, but they didn’t become popular until Charles Fey invented the first one called “Liberty Bell” in 1895. At that time, slot machines were limited to Nevada casinos, but they eventually spread to other states and now can be found in virtually every casino in America.

#  Blackjack is the most profitable live casino game, study finds – Live 888

Blackjack is the most profitable live casino game, according to a study by Live 888.

The study found that blackjack offers the best expected return to players of all live casino games. This means that, on average, blackjack players can expect to make more money playing this game than any other live casino game.

The study also found that blackjack is the most popular live casino game. This is likely due to the fact that it offers the best odds for players.

So if you’re looking to make some money at a live casino, be sure to hit the blackjack table!

#  Roulette is the second most profitable game for casinos – Live 888

Casinos make the bulk of their profits from slot machines, but roulette is a very close second. The house edge in roulette is about 2.7%, while in slots it can be as high as 10%.

This is why you’ll find more roulette tables in casinos than any other game. They may not be as exciting as blackjack or slots, but they are certainly more profitable for the casinos.

Roulette has been around since the 17th century, and it remains one of the most popular casino games today. There are a variety of ways to bet on roulette, which makes it a game that appeals to both beginners and experienced players.

There are a few different versions of roulette, but the most popular is American roulette. This version has 38 numbered slots (1 through 36, plus 0 and 00), and players can bet on whether the ball will land on a particular number or one of 18 different groups of numbers.

European roulette is similar to American roulette, but with one important difference: there is only one zero slot on the wheel, instead of two in American roulette. This reduces the house edge to about 2.6%.

Roulette can be played for small stakes or for high stakes, depending on your budget. The minimum bet at most casinos is usually just a few dollars, so it’s a game that everyone can afford to play.

If you want to try your hand at roulette, there are a few things you need to know before you start playing. The first thing is how to place your bets. There are a variety of betting options available, and each one has its own payout odds. You should read up on the different bets before you start playing so that you understand how they work.

The second thing you need to know is the house edge. This is the percentage of each bet that the casino takes as profit. As we mentioned earlier, the house edge in American roulette is 2.7%, while in European roulette it’s 2.6%. So if you’re betting $5 on a single number in American roulette, you stand to lose $13.70 (2.7% x $5) over time if the ball lands on zero or double-zero.

The third thing you need to know is how to calculate your odds of winning . This depends on the type of bet you make and the number selected. You can use an online calculator to help you figure out your chances of winning before you start playing .

#  Baccarat is the least profitable live casino game, study finds – Live 888

According to a new study by Live 888, baccarat is the least profitable live casino game. The study, which surveyed over 1,000 casino players, found that blackjack was the most profitable live game, generating an average return of 5.9%.

Baccarat was next on the list, with an average return of just 2.5%. This was followed by roulette (2%), craps (1.9%) and slot machines (1.8%).

Commenting on the findings, a spokesperson for Live 888 said: "These results are quite surprising and show that baccarat is not as profitable as some people might think. Players looking to make the most money from their live casino games should stick to blackjack."

The spokesperson added that blackjack offered a "great chance of winning real money", with players typically able to achieve a return of over 100% on their bets.

#  Studies find that slot machines are the most profitable live casino game – Live 888

Slot machines are known to be one of the most profitable live casino games. Studies have found that they generate more profits for casinos than any other game. In this article, we will discuss the reasons behind this and take a look at some of the top slot machines that you can find in online casinos.

There are several factors that make slot machines so profitable for casinos. Firstly, they are extremely popular with players. Slot machines account for around 70% of all the money wagered in live casino games. This is because they are very easy to play and offer players the chance to win big payouts.

Secondly, slots offer casinos a high return on investment. The average RTP (return to player) for slot machines is around 95%. This is much higher than the RTPs for other casino games such as blackjack and roulette which are around 50%. This means that casinos make more money from slot machines than any other game.

Finally, slots are a very low risk game for casinos. The odds of winning jackpots are much lower than the odds of winning in other casino games, meaning that casinos lose less money when players lose on slots.

All of these factors mean that slot machines are by far the most profitable game for live casinos. If you want to try your luck at winning big payouts, then be sure to check out some of the best slot machines available at online casinos.
