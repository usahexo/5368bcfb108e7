#  Ratiopharm Ulm Poised To Make A Run At The Bundesliga Title

_Ratiopharm Ulm is a professional basketball team from the city of Ulm, Germany. The team plays in the Bundesliga, the top tier of German basketball._

This season, Ratiopharm Ulm looks poised to make a run at the Bundesliga title. Led by star point guard Vasilije Micic, the team has been one of the best in Germany so far this season.

Ulm has already beaten some of the top teams in Germany this season, including Bayern Munich and Alba Berlin. They also have a win over reigning Bundesliga champions Brose Bamberg.

Micic has been one of the biggest stars for Ratiopharm Ulm this season. He is averaging 16 points and 5 assists per game this season. He has also been very efficient from beyond the arc, shooting 41 percent from 3-point range.

Other players like Daniel Theis and Mike Schmitz have also played key roles for Ratiopharm Ulm this season. Theis is averaging 13 points and 9 rebounds per game, while Schmitz is averaging 8 points and 4 assists per game.

Ratiopharm Ulm currently sits in second place in the Bundesliga standings with a record of 10-3. They are just two games behind first-place Bayern Munich and look poised to make a run at the title down the stretch.

#  NBA Picks: Cleveland Cavaliers +8 Over Ratiopharm Ulm

The Cleveland Cavaliers (8-7) will take on Ratiopharm Ulm (3-11) on Wednesday. Cleveland is a heavy favorite with an expected point spread of 8.5 points, but Ratiopharm Ulm has had some success against NBA teams in the past.

Ratiopharm Ulm is 0-3 this season against NBA teams, but they did knock off the Oklahoma City Thunder back in 2016 with a final score of 93-89. That one game doesn’t make them a serious threat to the Cavaliers, but it’s worth noting that they have had some success in the past.

Cleveland is coming off of a loss to the Toronto Raptors, and they will be looking to get back into the win column on Wednesday. Cleveland has been inconsistent this season, but they have plenty of talent on their roster and should be able to take care of business against Ratiopharm Ulm.

LeBron James continues to play at an MVP level, and he will be looking to lead the Cavaliers to victory on Wednesday. The rest of Cleveland’s starting lineup is also solid, with Kevin Love, JR Smith, George Hill and Tristan Thompson all being capable players.

Ratiopharm Ulm will be playing without Maurice Taylor Jr., who is out indefinitely with an ankle injury. This is a major blow for Ratiopharm Ulm, as Taylor Jr. is their leading scorer this season. Without him, they will be at a major disadvantage against Cleveland.

It’s tough to pick against LeBron James and the Cavaliers in this matchup. They are the better team and should be able to win by more than 8 points. Bet on the Cleveland Cavaliers -8 over Ratiopharm Ulm on Wednesday.

#  Can Ratiopharm Ulm upset the odds and win the Champions League?

Ratiopharm Ulm, a German basketball club, has made it to the final of the Champions League. They will be taking on Real Madrid, who are the favourites to win. However, Ratiopharm Ulm have shown that they are capable of upsetting the odds, and they could well do so again in the final.

Ratiopharm Ulm have had an excellent season so far. They won their group in the Champions League, beating teams such as Maccabi Tel Aviv and Strasbourg in the process. They then went on to beat CSKA Moscow in the quarter-finals, before defeating Bayern Munich in the semi-finals. This has been a remarkable run for a team that is not considered to be one of the top clubs in Europe.

Real Madrid are undoubtedly favourites to win the Champions League. However, they have not been at their best this season. They were knocked out of the Spanish Cup by Leganes, and they only just scraped through their Champions League group. They also lost to Barcelona in El Clasico last weekend.

Ratiopharm Ulm will be hoping that Real Madrid’s poor form continues in the final. They will also be looking to take advantage of their home court advantage. The final will be played at Ulm’s home stadium, and this could give them an edge over Real Madrid.

It is going to be a tough task for Ratiopharm Ulm to upset the odds and win the Champions League trophy. However, they have already shown that they can beat some of Europe’s top teams, and they will certainly be giving it their all in the final.
