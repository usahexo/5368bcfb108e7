#  How John Updike's Blackjack Payout Strategy Will Help You Win!

Do you love playing blackjack for the chance to win big payouts? Do you want to know the best way to play so that you can get the most out of each hand? If so, John Updike's blackjack payout strategy is perfect for you!

This strategy is designed to help you make the most of every hand by giving you the best possible odds of winning. It takes into account all of the different factors that can affect your chances of winning, including your hand value, the dealer's upcard, and the number of decks being used.

So how does it work? Here's a look at step-by-step guide to using John Updike's blackjack payout strategy:

1. Start by figuring out your hand value. This is done by adding together the value of your cards. Ace equals 1 point, 2 through 10 are face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) equals 10 points.

2. Next, check the dealer's upcard and determine what action to take. If the dealer has an Ace upcard, hit unless you have a total of 17 or more points; if the dealer has a 2 through 6 upcard, stand unless you have a total of 12 or less points. For all other dealer upcards, hit if your total is 16 or less and stand if your total is 17 or more.

3. Now use this chart to determine your next move:









 



	 If You Have 	 Dealer's Upcard Is 	 You Should Do

	 	 	 4 or Less 	 Hit 	 5 or More 	 Stand




4. Finally, keep in mind that this strategy assumes that there are two decks being used in the game. If there are more or fewer decks being used, adjust your play accordingly.

#  Learn John Updike's Secret to Winning at Blackjack!

John Updike was one of the most successful and renowned American writers of the 20th century. A mainstay of the New Yorker magazine for decades, he published 22 novels, six collections of short stories, and five books of poetry.

Updike was also a keen blackjack player, and was known to enjoy a game or two at the casino. In this article, we're going to look at his blackjack strategy, and how you can use it to beat the dealers and take home some serious winnings!

# The Basics

Updike's blackjack strategy is based on two simple principles: counting cards, and making smart betting decisions. Let's take a look at each in more detail.

# Card Counting

Card counting is a technique that allows players to gain an advantage over the house by keeping track of the cards that have been dealt. When done correctly, card counting can give you a slight edge over the dealer, which can be enough to turn the tables in your favor.

There are various methods for counting cards, but Updike's preferred system is called Hi-Lo. In this system, cards are assigned values according to their rank: 2 through 6 are worth +1 point each, 7 through 9 are worth 0 points each, and 10 through Ace are worth -1 point each. When adding up the points for all of the cards in play, you get a running total that tells you how advantageous or disadvantageous the deck currently is for you.

If the running total is positive (meaning there are more high cards left in the deck), then this is advantageous for the player as it means they have a higher chance of getting good cards. Conversely, if the running total is negative (meaning there are more low cards left in the deck), then this is disadvantageous for the player as it means they have a higher chance of getting bad cards.

By keeping track of the running total and adjusting your bet size accordingly, you can maximize your profits while minimizing your losses. For more information on how to count cards effectively, check out our guide here [LINK].

# Smart Betting Decisions

In addition to counting cards, it's also important to make smart betting decisions based on what's happening in the game. Here are some tips for doing just that:

- If you have a good hand (e.g. an Ace with a 10 value card), increase your bet size . This will maximize your profits if you manage to win)

- If you have a bad hand (e .g . an Ace with only a 1 or 2 value card), decrease your bet size . This will minimize your losses if you end up losing)

- If there's no clear advantage either way (e .g . when there are mostly low value cards left in play), keep your bet size relatively small

#  Follow John Updike's Guide to Winning at Blackjack and Be a Winner!

Casinos make billions of dollars each year from blackjack players, but with a bit of knowledge and the following guide from John Updike, you can be one of the winners and not one of the losers.

Updike begins by telling us that blackjack is a game of odds, and as such, mathematical probability is key to winning. In order to understand these odds, we must first understand how blackjack works. There are two ways to win at blackjack: either by getting 21 points on your first two cards (a “natural”), or by having a higher total than the dealer without going over 21. The Ace is worth 1 or 11 points, face cards are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.

If we take a look at the basic strategy chart below, we can see the best move in most situations. For instance, if you are dealt an Ace and a 4 (total of 5), the best move is to hit (take another card). If you are dealt 2 and 3 (total of 5), the best move is to stand (not take any more cards).

The next step is to start using some basic playing arithmetic. Let's say that you have been dealt an Ace and 6 (total of 7). Rather than just blindly hitting (taking another card), let's see what happens if we hit and get another Ace. Our total would then be 18 (Ace + 7 + Ace), which is over 21 and therefore busts. On the other hand, if we hit and get a 3 instead, our new total would be 10 (Ace + 3 + 7), which is lower than the dealer's total of 13 and therefore would be a winner. By understanding basic playing arithmetic like this, we can start making better decisions about when to hit or stand. 

One final note before moving on: insurance bets. When the dealer has an Ace showing, he will offer players insurance against them busting (getting over 21). This bet pays 2-1 if the dealer does indeed bust, so it's essentially a 50/50 bet as to whether or not the dealer will go over 21. However, as Updike rightly points out, this bet is generally a bad idea for most players. Unless you have inside information on what the dealer's hole card is (the card he has yet to reveal), it's usually not worth making this bet. 

With all that in mind, let's take a look at John Updike's five tips for winning at blackjack:

1) Learn basic strategy – As discussed above, learning basic strategy is key to winning at blackjack. Thankfully, there are plenty of resources out there that can help teach you these strategies, including our very own [Basic Strategy Chart](https://www.smartcasinogaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Basic-Strategy-Chart-for-Blackjack-.pdf "Basic Strategy Chart for Blackjack"). 
2) Use proper betting technique – Don't just throw money down on every hand; spread your bets out intelligently to increase your chances of winning. 
3) Use proper money management – Don't go overboard when you're winning or losing; keep your betting amounts consistent no matter what the outcome may be. 
4) Make use of house edges – The casino has edges built into the game in order to make money in the long run; use these edges to your advantage where possible. 
5) Know when enough is enough – There will come a time when you've had enough wins or losses; know when it's time to walk away from the table
