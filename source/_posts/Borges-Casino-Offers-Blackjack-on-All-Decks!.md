Blackjack Mulligan is a variant that is based on traditional blackjack, but with a few twists. In this game, players can split any two cards, regardless of their rank. Moreover, players are also allowed to double down after splitting. This makes the game much more exciting and provides players with more opportunities to win big payouts.

Blackjack Switch is another exciting variant that offers plenty of excitement and action. This game is played with six decks of cards and features a side bet called “Perfect Pairs”. In this side bet, players are betting on whether their first two cards will be a pair or not. If they are, they win automatically! This makes for an intense and thrilling game.
