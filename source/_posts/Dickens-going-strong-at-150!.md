#  Dickens going strong at 150!

Dicken's remains one of the most popular and beloved authors in history, with his novels still selling millions of copies every year.

The author was born on February 7, 1812, and died on June 9, 1870. That means this year marks the 150th anniversary of Dickens' death - and a number of events are being held to celebrate his life and work.

Dickens wrote extensively about the life of people in London during the 1800s, and his novels are filled with elements of tragedy, humor, and romance. His characters - including Ebenezer Scrooge, Pip, and Little Dorrit - are still widely recognized and quoted today.

Despite his popularity, Dickens was not always treated well by critics during his lifetime. He was often lambasted for writing "trashy" stories that appealed to the masses instead of more literary audiences. However, he continued to write prolifically throughout his career and produced some of the most celebrated works in English literature.

Dickens' influence is still evident in books and movies today. Many modern authors credit him as an inspiration, and his characters continue to appear in popular culture references. There's no doubt that Dickens will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come!
