#  Gambling relapse: what to do when you feel like giving up

Gambling addiction can be a difficult habit to overcome. Even if you have been doing well in your recovery, there may be times when you feel like giving up. When relapse temptations strike, it is important to have a plan in place to help you stay on track.

The first step is to identify the sources of temptation. What are the things that make you feel like gambling? Is it being around other people who are gambling? Is it being in a casino or other gambling environment? Is it seeing betting ads or hearing about people winning big? Once you know what your temptation triggers are, you can work on avoiding them or managing them.

If you can't avoid the temptation altogether, then you need to have strategies in place for dealing with it. One idea is to remove all money from your vicinity when you are struggling. This way, you can't impulsively gamble with whatever cash you have on hand. Another idea is to set strict rules for yourself and stick to them. For example, tell yourself that you will only gamble a certain amount of money and no more. Or tell yourself that you will only gamble during certain hours of the day.

If relapse does happen, don't beat yourself up about it. Just remember that every stumble is an opportunity to learn and get back on track. The most important thing is to keep moving forward in your recovery journey. With time and patience, you will be able to overcome your gambling addiction for good.
