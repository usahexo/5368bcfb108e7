#  The Orca Magic Game is close to the San Juan Airport!

The Orca Magic Game, designed by Raul Rubio and developed by Tequila Works, is a five-minute game for two players that can be played almost anywhere. This fast and easy-to-play game is close to the San Juan Airport and only costs $5 to play.

In Orca Magic Game, each player controls an orca trying to catch fish. The player who catches the most fish wins the game. To catch fish, the player must first dive down to the bottom of the ocean, then come back up with a fish in their mouth. The player can also use their orca’s magical powers to help them catch more fish.

The game board for Orca Magic is a simple grid of nine squares, three squares wide and three squares tall. There are four different types of sea creatures in the game: salmon, mackerel, shrimp, and crab. Each creature is worth a different number of points: salmon are worth one point each, mackerel are worth two points each, shrimp are worth three points each, and crabs are worth four points each.

The game starts with both players having two pieces of ice on their side of the board. On a player’s turn, they must do one of the following:


1) Move one piece of ice to any empty square on their side of the board.

2) Place an ice cube in any square on their side of the board.

3) Use their orca’s magical power to move an ice cube from any square on their opponent’s side of the board to any empty square on their own side of the board.

4) Catch a fish by diving down to the bottom of the ocean with an ice cube in their mouth, then coming back up with a fish in their mouth. If they cannot capture a fish this way, they lose one point.


If at any time a player has no more pieces of ice left on their side of the board, they lose one point for every fish they have caught so far in the game. The player who has caught the most points at the end of the game wins!
