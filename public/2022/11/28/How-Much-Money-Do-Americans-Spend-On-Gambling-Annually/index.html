<p>That’s how much Europeans are thought to spend on gambling annually, making it one of the most popular leisure activities in the region. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Sweden, gambling is even more popular than football.</p>
<p>But where does all that money go? And who are the biggest gamblers in Europe?</p>

<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Does-The-World-Spend-On-Gambling-Annually"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Does-The-World-Spend-On-Gambling-Annually" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Does The World Spend On Gambling Annually?"></a>How Much Money Does The World Spend On Gambling Annually?</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is a popular pastime around the world. People gamble for different reasons, but the most common reason is to try and make money. So, how much money does the world spend on gambling each year?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer to this question as it varies from country to country. However, according to a report by The Economist, the global gambling market was worth an estimated $445 billion in 2015. This number is expected to grow to $577 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>So, where does all this money come from? And where does it go?</p>
<p>The largest chunk of the global gambling market comes from casino games. In 2015, casino games accounted for $209 billion of the total market. This number is expected to grow to $269 billion by 2020. The second largest segment is sports betting, which accounted for $46 billion of the market in 2015 and is expected to grow to $64 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>In terms of where the money goes, it generally goes back into gambling businesses. For example, casinos use their profits to build new casinos and expand their operations, while bookmakers use their profits to offer more competitive odds and attract new customers. There are also a number of people who make a living from gambling-related activities such as betting tips or selling information about forthcoming matches.</p>
<p>So, what does all this mean for gamblers?</p>
<p>Well, firstly it shows that gambling is a big business and there are plenty of people who are making money from it. Secondly, it means that there is always going to be competition amongst gambling businesses to offer better products and services. Finally, it means that gamblers need to be aware that they are playing against some very shrewd operators who have a lot of money at their disposal.</p>

<p>Australians have a strong love affair with gambling, with the average person spending around $1,000 per year on various forms of gambling. This amounts to around $22 per week or $3.50 per day. Gambling expenditure has been steadily increasing over the years, with Australians spending more money on gambling now than ever before.</p>
<p>Interestingly, men tend to gamble more than women, with men spending an average of $1,500 per year compared to women who spend around $750 per year. This may be due to the fact that many forms of gambling are geared towards men, such as sports betting and casino games.</p>
<p>The states and territories in Australia that spend the most money on gambling are New South Wales and Victoria. These states account for almost 60% of all gambling expenditure in Australia. In New South Wales, people spend an average of $1,200 per year on gambling, while Victorian residents spend an average of $1,300 per year.</p>
<p>So why do Australians love to gamble so much? There are many reasons why people gamble, but one of the main reasons is because it is exciting and fun.

Additionally, many people see gambling as a way to make money or to get rich quick.</p>

<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Is-Spent-On-Gambling-In-Canada-Annually"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Is-Spent-On-Gambling-In-Canada-Annually" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Is Spent On Gambling In Canada Annually?"></a>How Much Money Is Spent On Gambling In Canada Annually?</h1><p>A recent study by the Canadian Gaming Association (CGA) reveals that Canadians spent $22.3 billion on gambling in 2016. This is equivalent to $1,048 per capita. The largest share of spending, $16.8 billion, was on traditional gaming activities such as lotteries, casinos, and bingo. Another $5.5 billion was wagered on sports betting, horseracing, and online poker.</p>
<p>The biggest spenders were Ontarians, who gambled away $10.1 billion in 2016. This accounted for 45% of the national total, and was equivalent to $1,514 per capita. Quebeckers came in second with a total expenditure of $5.6 billion, followed by British Columbians at $3.7 billion and Albertans at $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>The CGA report also finds that problem gambling costs Canadians an estimated $4.7 billion annually in direct and indirect costs. This includes money spent on treatment and counselling services, as well as lost productivity and income caused by addiction problems.</p>
<p>Gambling has been a part of Canadian culture for centuries, but its popularity has grown in recent years thanks to the advent of online casinos and sports betting sites. While most people gamble without any negative consequences, there is a small percentage who develop a serious addiction that can ruin their lives.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help from a qualified professional. There is no shame in admitting that you have a problem and seeking assistance to overcome it. Gambling addiction is a real disease that can be treated successfully if you get the right help.</p>
