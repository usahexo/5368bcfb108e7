        <h1 id="How-Many-Online-Gambling-Websites-Are-There"><a href="#How-Many-Online-Gambling-Websites-Are-There" class="headerlink" title="How Many Online Gambling Websites Are There?"></a>How Many Online Gambling Websites Are There?</h1><p>There is no confirmed answer to this question as there is no central repository of online gambling websites. However, a quick Google search will reveal that the number of online gambling websites is in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>This high number is due, in part, to the fact that online gambling is a global industry. In fact, it is estimated that the online gambling market will be worth more than $60 billion by 2020. This popularity has led to a proliferation of online gambling websites, many of which are not reputable.</p>
<p>This raises a couple of important issues for consumers. The first issue is that it can be difficult to determine which websites are legitimate and which ones are not. The second issue is that there are many scam sites out there that will attempt to steal your money.</p>
<p>So, how can you protect yourself when choosing an online gambling website? The first step is to do your research. Read reviews and comparison guides to find the best websites. Then, ensure that the website you choose is licensed and regulated by a reputable authority.</p>
<p>Finally, be sure to only use trusted payment methods like PayPal or credit cards, and never give away your personal information unless you are confident in the website’s security measures. following these tips should help you stay safe when enjoying some fun online gambling!</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Rapid-Growth-In-Online-Gambling-Sites"><a href="#Study-Shows-Rapid-Growth-In-Online-Gambling-Sites" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Rapid Growth In Online Gambling Sites"></a>Study Shows Rapid Growth In Online Gambling Sites</h1><p>A recent study shows that there has been a rapid growth in online gambling sites over the past few years. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Oxford, found that the number of online gambling sites has more than tripled since 2008.</p>
<p>The study also found that the amount of money wagered on these sites has grown significantly as well. In fact, the total amount wagered online is now estimated to be around $35 billion per year.</p>
<p>This rapid growth in online gambling is likely due to a number of factors. For one thing, it is becoming increasingly easy and convenient to gamble online. In addition, many people are drawn to the excitement and thrill of gambling online.</p>
<p>While online gambling can be fun and exciting, it can also be risky. It is important to remember that like any other form of gambling, there is always the potential for losing money when playing online games.</p>
<p>So if you do choose to gamble online, be sure to do so responsibly and only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. And remember to always read the Terms and Conditions carefully before signing up for any site.</p>
<h1 id="Number-Of-Online-Gambling-Sites-Continue-To-Grow"><a href="#Number-Of-Online-Gambling-Sites-Continue-To-Grow" class="headerlink" title="Number Of Online Gambling Sites Continue To Grow"></a>Number Of Online Gambling Sites Continue To Grow</h1><p>In spite of controversies and debates on the morality of gambling, the number of online gambling sites continue to grow. In the UK alone, there are over 600 licensed gambling operators, according to a 2016 report by the Gambling Commission. And this is just the UK – many other countries have even more online gambling operators.</p>
<p>Critics may say that this burgeoning industry is a sign of society’s moral decay, but others view it as simply a reflection of people’s choices and desires. Gambling has been around for centuries and shows no signs of disappearing any time soon.</p>
<p>So what motivates people to gamble online? There are many reasons, but some of the most common include wanting to win money, boredom, and socialising with friends. Some people also enjoy the excitement and adrenaline rush that comes with playing games of chance.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, there’s no doubt that online gambling is a booming industry. Operators are constantly coming up with new ways to attract customers, such as offering bonuses, loyalty programs, and even cryptocurrency payments.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about getting into online gambling, it’s important to do your research first. There are many scams out there, so make sure you only use reputable operators. Also be aware of the risks involved and only gamble what you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="Australians-Favor-Gambling-Websites-Over-Traditional-Ones"><a href="#Australians-Favor-Gambling-Websites-Over-Traditional-Ones" class="headerlink" title="Australians Favor Gambling Websites Over Traditional Ones"></a>Australians Favor Gambling Websites Over Traditional Ones</h1><p>A recent study by gambling research firm Essential has found that a majority of Australians favor gambling websites over traditional ones. The study, which was conducted in partnership with Google, surveyed 1,500 Australian adults and found that 63 percent of respondents favored gambling websites, while only 37 percent favored traditional bookmakers.</p>
<p>The survey also found that 48 percent of Australian adults have gambled online in the past year, up from 41 percent in 2016. Furthermore, the average amount spent on online gambling in the past year was $1,380, with men spending almost twice as much as women.</p>
<p>While the growth of online gambling is good news for the industry, it is also raising concerns about addiction and money laundering. In a statement, Google’s head of public policy for Australia and New Zealand Rachel Whetstone said that the company is committed to working with regulators to ensure that people are protected while enjoying lawful online sports betting.</p>
<p>The findings of the study come as no surprise to those working in the online gambling industry. According to Greg Matthews, CEO of online bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral Australia, Australians have been moving away from traditional bookmakers towards gambling websites because they offer a better experience.</p>
<p>“Australians are voting with their feet and moving away from high street bookmakers in droves and embracing digital experiences instead – and we’re seeing this across all forms of betting including racing, sports and casino games,” Matthews said in a statement.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been growing rapidly around the world in recent years. A report by market research firm Technavio predicts that the global online gambling market will grow at a CAGR of more than 11 percent from 2017 to 2021.</p>
